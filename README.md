# homework-task_2048
It's my first project sent to GitHub. I don't want to screw up~
I'm a college student from CHINA(sure I love my motherland).
But as we all know, China's Internet is strange. It even blocks GitHub.
But I like coding(well, I don't understand the meaning between coding and programming). I will, and must study hard, for some reason
That's all. I still have a long way to go...
